# Use map() to double the values in an array

## Problem Domain
Use map() to double the values in an array.

## Solution
They provided a link to the MDN help page, so I simply copied and pasted the example code, used the name of the array provided into the example, and returned the variable in the example.  It worked, and I could not find another solution that was as transparent as mine.
